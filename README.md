# CAPP-Int-Rebuild-Responsive

I recently had the opportunity to do a full 
rebuild of CAPP International. I cloned the 
look of the old site and used Bootstrap to 
make it responsive, with the added benefit 
of much less resources and quicker page 
loads. With the new website I am now able to 
change the content much easier without all 
the old, bloated HTML code of the previous 
version. I also divided each section of my 
pages into PHP Include files so I can make 
changes in one place instead of making the 
same changes on every page of the website.
