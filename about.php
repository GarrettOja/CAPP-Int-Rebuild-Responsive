        <h4>My name is Dan Ewert and I believe the story is important because as
          your appraiser it is important that you understand, I see things through
          life of experience and hands on training. I bring this all to bear on
          your needs and requirements. No matter what your asset package consists
          of there is a good chance I have touched the application in some way.
          Either in a practical hands on way over the years or though another
          clients asset group.

      My beginnings were in the construction business with my father from the
      late 50's. We plumbed a lot of houses and commercial buildings in the
      Great Northwest. When Uncle Sam needed me in the early 70's the Air Force
      trained me in Electrical Power Production. I also served an additional
      9 years in the Oregon Air National Guard after leaving the Air Force.
      I completed my BS Degree in Diesel Engineering with a co- minor in
      Industrial Education. With that experience I have worked for a number of
      companies including Peter Kewit, Caterpillar, Genstar, William Scotsman
      and others. I started working in the shop and worked my way up into
      management and a few years later owning and operating my own business's.
      The last of these business en-devours was sold to Freightliner
      Corporation in 1999.<br><br>
      In 2000 I retired and decided to change careers. After a brief ownership
      as a partner in an electrical contracting company and working with a
      local auction company, I attended Western Collage of Auctioneering and
      became a Certified Auctioneer and then went on to become a Fully Trained
      Personal Property Appraiser.<br><br>
      That was 17 years ago and I am pleased to say that I am still doing what
      I love Appraisals and Auctioneering (liquidations). It has been a great
      run and I am now involved with over 150 auctions a year and appraising
      many millions of dollars worth of assets for banks, lending companies
      and private entities each year.<br><br>
      Thanks for walking with me through my story, I hope you made it all the
      way to the end. I look forward to meeting and talking with you some time
      soon. My company is built on the motto “Given good information our
      clients can make good and strong decisions” I would enjoy working with
      you!<br><br>
      I am a Fully Trained Personal Property Appraiser. A Personal Property
      Appraiser is a Professional Technician that is trained and has experience
      in what may be better termed as Asset Valuation. This would be tangible
      or non-tangible items such as equipment, tooling, antiques, or business
      assets such as customer base, inventory and accounts receivable.<br><br>
      This is not to be confused with a Real Property Appraiser which is a
      technician trained in the areas of Real Estate Appraisal (the building
      and the ground it sets on).<br><br>
      With my training, experience and diversified background in many
      different areas I can give you a real time asset valuation that can
      be used by lending institutions, company mergers, company down sizing,
      asset consolidation. The valuations that I produce are not just numbers
      pulled from the internet or sales periodicals but are also based on years
      of hands on experience working with many different types of equipment but
      also selling those assets in private treaty negotiations, seal bid and
      auction formats.<br><br>
      All of my appraisals are completed with in the USPAP guidelines for
      appraisers. The documentation that you will receive will present the
      assets in a understandable format. All reports include detailed
      information including descriptions, quantities, and model numbers,
      serial numbers and photo gallery of the majority of assets appraised.
      All documents are suitable for use for SBA Loan documentation,
      Bankruptcy or any type of court litigation. As a Trained Expert Witness
      for the Courts I develop documents that I personally can depend on if
      needed.
